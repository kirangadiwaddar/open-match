                      In general, payments once made, are not refunded under any circumstances. In other words, you do not have the option of cancelling or getting a refund for any payment.

Such refunds will be issued within 7 business days.

                    <h4>How do we protect your personal data?</h4>
                    <p>
                      We try our best to ensure that your Personal Data is protected and secure from unauthorized or unlawful access, alteration, disclosure, use or destruction. We encrypt our services using SSL, the data is accessible only through a secret password and digital signatures, and our employees only have access to your data on a need-to-know basis. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not always completely secure. Although we take all reasonable measures, we cannot guarantee the security of the data you transmit to our Website or App; any transmission is at your own risk.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How long do we retain your personal data?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Your Personal Data is retained no longer than strictly necessary or as long as allowed by law, whichever is shorter. In the event that you have not logged in to your profile for five years, your Personal Data may be erased from our records. Of course, you can always contact our support team through your registered email address with a request to delete your data from our records.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Changes to this privacy policy</h4>
                    <p>
                      We are constantly looking for new ways to improve OpenMatch and we may unilaterally update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When there is a significant change in this Privacy Policy, you will see a pop up in the app which you will have to accept before you can continue to use OpenMatch.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Storage and transfer of your personal data</h4>

                      You can also view, edit or delete your Personal Data by logging in to your OpenMatch account. To protect loss of data due to natural disasters and other such unforeseeable circumstances, we store your details as backup for a safety retention window of upto three years following account deletion.
